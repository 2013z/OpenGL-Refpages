Branch of ES 1.1 man pages to be brought up to date for publication.
This includes a framed HTML frontend based on the work Benj Lipchak did
for the desktop OpenGL reference pages in its SDK (www.opengl.org/sdk/),
but considerably stripped down (since we have no SDK content other than
the reference pages, yet), and converted from PHP to pure HTML so it can
be browsed out of Subversion or in a local disk copy.
